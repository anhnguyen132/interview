Lowest Common Ancestor
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example:

Input: [3, 5, 1, 4, 9, 2]    
           3      p = 5, q = 2
          / \
         5   1
        / \   \
       4   9   2

Output: 3
