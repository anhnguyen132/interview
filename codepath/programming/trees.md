# Trees

## Binary Trees
- A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, usually distinguished as "left" and "right."

##  Heaps
### Binary heaps
- Binary heaps are one kind of binary tree
- Have a few special restrictions, in addition to the usual binary tree:
    - Must be **complete**: No “gaps”—nodes are filled in left-to-right on each level (row) of the tree
    - Ordering of data must obey **heap property**
        - Min-heap version: a parent’s data is always ≤ both its children’s data. (root = min value in whole tree)
        - Max-heap version: a parent’s data is always ≥ both its children’s data. (root = max value in whole tree)

### Other kinds of heaps
- Binomial heap
