# Technical Questions
For each topic, know how to:

1. Use and implement them (Implement them from scratch for Data Structures and Algorithms)
2) Space and Time complexity

Hash tables is a popular concept.

## Data Structures
- Vectors/ Array/ Lists: Linked list
- String
- Stacks and Queues
- Sets and Maps
- Heaps
- Hash table
- Trees, Tries, and Graphs: e.g. Binary trees 

## Algorithms
- Sorting: 
    -  Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
- Searching:
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search
    - Binary Search
- Tree Insert/ Find/ etc.
